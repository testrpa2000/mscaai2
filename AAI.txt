Expert System
An expert system is a smart computer program that uses knowledge and logic to solve problems or make decisions in a specific area. 
It tries to copy how a human expert would think by putting their knowledge into the program.

AIML
Artificial Intelligence Markup Language
AIML is a type of language used to make chatbots and talk computers smarter. 
AIML helps chatbots better understand and talk like humans.

Bot
A bot is a type of software that can do tasks automatically, have conversations with people, or interact through text or voice. 
They can be simple with basic tasks or advanced with artificial intelligence to understand language and learn from interactions.

Bayes' Theorem 
is a math tool that helps to adjust the likelihood of something happening based on new info. 
It is helpful when we want to estimate how likely something is based on what we already know and what we see.

Conditional Probability: 
This is the chance of an event happening based on another event that has already happened.

Joint Probability: 
is the chance of multiple events happening at the same time. 
It shows how likely it is for two or more events to happen together.

Supervised Learning: 
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer learns from labeled data, which means data that includes the correct answers.

Unsupervised Learning: 
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer learns from data that does not have correct answers provided. 
The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data without any guidance.

Clustering Algorithm: 
Clustering algorithms group similar data points together without needing prior knowledge of the groups, helping to find patterns in the data. 

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm: 
SVM is a learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
It finds the best hyperplane to separate classes in data, aiming to maximize the margin between classes.

Regression 
is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for prediction, forecasting, and understanding the underlying relationship between variables.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
are computer systems that learn by imitating the brain's neural networks. 
They consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process input data and produce outputs through a training process. 

Feedforward is a specific type of neural network that processes information in one direction, without looping back. 
Each layer of neurons is connected to the next layer, and there are no connections within a layer or from higher to lower layers. It is commonly used for tasks like classification and pattern recognition.

Backpropagation is a method used to teach artificial neural networks to make predictions closer to the actual results. 
It does this by adjusting the network's internal settings based on the errors made during prediction. 
By making small changes to these settings, the network gets better at making accurate predictions over time.

Genetic Algorithm: 
Genetic algorithms are inspired by nature, specifically natural selection and genetics. 
They are a type of search-based algorithm and a part of computation methods.

Intelligent Agents: 
Intelligent agents are entities that can sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals. 
They can be software agents, robots, or other forms that use techniques like machine learning to adapt to different situations. 
They are used in various applications like autonomous systems and customer service bots.

Language parser is a tool that understands and grabs the important information from text. 
It uses different methods like rules, statistics, and deep learning. 
These tools are helpful in tasks like reading text, tagging words, recognizing names, and understanding sentence structure. 

Semantic Web helps machines understand the meaning of online content. 
It organizes data in a way that makes it easier for computers to process and make sense of. 
Some important technologies in Semantic Web are RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. 
To simulate the Semantic Web, we create structures to show relationships between things and add extra info to web content for better searching and understanding.

FuzzyWuzzy is a Python library used for fuzzy string matching. 

Rule-based system
It's like a smart computer system that can make choices and do things using specific rules and information it receives.
